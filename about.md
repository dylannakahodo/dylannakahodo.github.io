My name is Dylan Nakahodo and I'm seeking a Security Analyst role. I'm currently living in New York but originally I'm from Hawaii. I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa where I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering. This is my personal blog where I'll publish writeups and anything I find interesting.

Some topics of interest of mine are reverse-engineering, network and web pentesting, programming, and electronics/hardware.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in [CTFs](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), and learning about different security related topics.
