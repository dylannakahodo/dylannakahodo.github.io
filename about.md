Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Dylan Nakahodo and I'm a Junior Helpdesk Support at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). I'm currently living in New York but originally I'm from Hawaii. I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa where I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in CTFs and learning about various security related topics. The purpose of this blog is to share what I learn and what I'm currently working on. This is a work in progress, stay tuned for updates!
