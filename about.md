My name is Dylan and this is my personal blog where I'll publish writeups, research, projects, challenges, or whatever else I'm working on.  I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa where I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering.

Some topics of interest of mine are reverse enginering, network and web pentesting, malware, and hardware.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in [CTFs](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), and learning about different security related topics.
