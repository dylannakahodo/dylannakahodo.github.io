My name is Dylan and this is my personal blog where I'll publish writeups, research, projects, challenges, or whatever else I'm working on.  I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa where I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering. Currently work as a Data Security Analyst.

Some topics of interest of mine are reverse enginering, exploit dev, vulnerability research, and malware analysis. 

I enjoy participating in the occassional CTF, HackTheBox, and bug bounties. Pretty much anything that lets me dive in and get my hands dirty.
