2020 was a crazy year, I didn't achieve my goal of getting my OSCP before the end of 2020; however, I did get my first entry level security role as a Security Analyst. The purpose of this blog post is to capture my goals for 2021 and to try hold myself accountable.

Throughout this year, I learned a lot about myself, the best way I learn, and also what topics truly interest me. 

Below is a list of some of the goals I want to accomplish in 2021:

- Complete a write-up/blog post for each machine I complete on HTB
    - I need to get in the habit of documenting my findings and taking better notes.
- Reach max level on [BugBountHunter Barker](https://www.bugbountyhunter.com/)
    - This platform was created by zseano and is designed to give you hands on practice with bug bounties.
- Complete Beginner Malware Analysis Course and Zero2Automated Course
    - Reversing malware is still a fun topic to me and I want to keep my skills sharp.
- Finish reading "Practical Malware Analysis" and complete all labs
    - Same reasoning as above.
- Completing Nebula, Phoenix, and Fusion from [Exploit.Education](https://exploit.education/) (with writeups)
    - Need more hands on practice with exploitation and need to improve my writing.
- Complete [Pwn.College](https://pwn.college/) course
    - Same as above, want to improve in exploit dev
- Compelte all labs in [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
    - Been trying to get into bug bounties, completing all these labs will give me a good foundation
- Submit a valid report to a bug bounty program


Stretch goals:
- Apply to Synack Red Team
    - Depending on how well I do on bug bounties, joining SRT is a future goal. I've heard good things about SRT and the fact that you can join as a contractor while keeping a full-time job really resonates with me
