It's been a crazy year! I moved to New York, got an amazing job, and received a scholarship for 2 SANS courses.

First, the job. In June, I was hired as a Junior Helpdesk Support at Stack Overflow. I've been so busy at work, I haven't had much time to participate in many CTFs or keep up with this blog. But I plan to post some writeups from the CTFs I was able participate in this year in early 2019. I'm also planning on posting writeups for some of the boxes from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

The 2 SANS courses I signed up for were SEC401, "Security Essentials Bootcamp Style" and SEC504, "Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling" and each respective GIAC certification exam. I passed the GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC) exam in early December and I am currently taking SEC504 and planning on taking the GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) exam in early Februrary 2019.

I also won a free seat in eLearnSecurity's [Web Application Penetration Testing](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/web_application_penetration_testing/) course and exam attempt, which I also plan to complete in Februrary 2019.

In addition to the above, I'll be studying for my Network+ and Security+ as well.

All in all, 2019 is already looking like it's going to be a busy year and I hope to continue this level of intense studying.
