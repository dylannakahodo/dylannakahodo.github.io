After participating in the Flare-On challenge last year, I have been getting more and more interested in malware analysis, reverse engineering, and exploit development. Right now, I'm going to focus on learning more about reverse engineering and malware analysis. I've picked out a couple of books to go through and found some courses over at [OpenSecurityTraining](http://www.opensecuritytraining.info/Training.html). This post will cover a few of the things I'm going to be working on and the resources I'll be using.

My goal is to also post my notes as blog posts as I go through the courses to hold myself accountable and to not be lazy with my notetaking.

## Rough Study Plan

OpenSecurityTraining has a rough outline/skill tree that I'll be following and will supplement it with other resources. (Full list is on my resource page.)
