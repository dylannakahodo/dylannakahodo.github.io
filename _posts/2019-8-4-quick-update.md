title: "Quick Update"
---

Wow, it's definitely been a while since my last post. I've been really struggling to work on things lately, so my studying has been slow going. Quick update, I earned my GSEC and GCIH. I've also participated in a few CTFs, but I didn't complete any challenges worth doing a write-up for.  Currently I'm studying for my Network+ which I hope to get through and take the exam within the next month or two. Following that, I plan on studying for and earning my Sec+. Hopefully I can get these both done before the end of this year.


After I earn my Net+ and Sec+, I will take eLearnSecurity's Penetration Testing Professional course and hopefully earn my eCPPT. Following that, I'll work towards eLearnSecurity's Web App Penetration Testing course and hopefully earn the certification for that too. While all this is going on, I'm also supplementing my studying with Cybrary, I'm currently enrolled in their Penetration Tester career path. This will all culminate into me signing up for Offensive Security's "Penetration Testing with Kali" (PWK) course and work towards getting my OSCP.
