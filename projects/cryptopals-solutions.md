I've been slowly working through the [Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) to get more practice with Python and to dive into crypto. Progress has been slow going since I'm focusing on other things, but whenever I get the chance, I'll work on a problem here and there.

You can find my solutions in the following GitHub [repo](https://github.com/dylannakahodo/cryptopals).

Another resource I found useful is the book [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto).
