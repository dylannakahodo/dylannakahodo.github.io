This page will serve as a living document and list of resources I'll be using as I prepare for Offensive Security's [PWK course and OSCP exam](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)

### eLearnSecurity PTP Update

I was able to finish the PTP course and started working on the labs; however, after trying out a few of the labs, decided that it wasn't to my liking. So instead of taking the eCPPT exam, I will sign up for HTB VIP and focus on TJnull's OSCP-like machines and also sign up for the PWK.

I also found a new notetaking app that I like more than CherryTree, which is [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).

### HackTheBox VIP, Note-Taking and tuning Methodology

2 of the biggest issues I have when I tackle HackTheBox machines are my methodology and notetaking.

To expand on this, I don't think my methodology is as clean and well thought out as I'd like it to be, I tend to jump around a machine a lot, trying different things, going down rabbit holes, it's all very disorganized. Since the PWK lab has a time limit, I want to be able to use my time efficiently and I feel having a well thought out methodology will help with that. This leads to my next issue, notetaking.

My notetaking program of choice is CherryTree, since it comes pre-installed on Kali and I like the layout of the program. My notes start off okay, I create a node for my nmap scans and subnodes for any visible/interesting services and ports. It all falls apart when I try to get the initial foothold on the machine. I dive down rabbit holes, trying one thing after another, extremely hyper-focused. My notes end up having random screenshots, different things I've tried, and what worked, but not much else. Since the OSCP requires a report at the end of the exam, having excellent notes and screenshots is essential. To address both of these, I'm going to slowly go through the following HackTheBox OSCP-like machines (curated by TJnull) and build up my methodology. I'll probably make walkthroughs/writeups for each machine and I'll link to each post on this page.

TJnull also put together an AMAZING prep guide for the PWK/OSCP [here](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html).

After I finish a box, I'll reference Ippsec's walkthrough for it to see a different approach and make note of anything I might miss. [OSCP Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DqdPcbYcy8&list=PLidcsTyj9JXK-fnabFLVEvHinQ14Jy5tf)

### eLearnSecurity

Some additional prep-work I'll be doing is taking eLearnSecurity's [Penetration Testing Professional](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing/) (PTP) course and eLearnSecurity's Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) exam. In addition to the course, you're also supplied labs that go with each module, so you're given hands on practice as you learn the material. I've heard from many people that they really enjoyed this course and said that the practical exam taught them a lot and served as a good stepping stone into the PWK and OSCP.

These are the different sections covered by the PTP course:

- System Security
- Network Security
- PowerShell for Pentesters
- Linux Exploitation
- Web App Security
- WiFi Security
- Ruby for Pentesters and Metasploit
